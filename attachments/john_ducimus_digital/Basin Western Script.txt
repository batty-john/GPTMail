               A young girl, CICILIA (13), is peaking out of the blinds of
               the front window of her house.  She is looking for her dad to
               come home.  



               INT. JOHN AND JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY 

               JENNY (29), is trying to tie the end of a balloon for a
               birthday party. A half frosted birthday cake and gifts are on
               the counter.  Streamers are stretched from one end of the
               room to the other. Cicilia turns around and listens to her
               mom on the phone.     

                                   JENNY 
                         You've been on the road twenty four
                         days of every single month for the
                         last two years, John!  It's her
                         twelfth  birthday and you've missed
                         the last two ... and Christmas, and
                         Thanksgiving, and our anniversary. 
                         You need to come home now, John!  



               INT. JOHN'S TRUCK - DAY 

               JOHN (30), is driving an eighteen-wheeler truck, trying to
               talk on the phone.   

                                   JOHN 
                         I'm in Arkansas, Jen, I can't just
                         transport myself into the front
                         room of our house! 



               INT. JOHN AND JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY 

               The air escapes the balloon and Jenny gives up on it, she
               tosses it aside.  

                                   JENNY
                         You need to find a different job.
                         I'm sick of trying to explain to
                         the kids why you're never here! 



               INT. JOHN'S TRUCK - DAY 

                                   JOHN
                         I'm sorry. This is the way we make
                         a living.  What do you want from
                         me?   



               INT. JOHN AND JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY 

               Jenny picks up a frosting knife and starts to frost the cake. 

                                   JENNY 
                         I want you to be in your children's
                         lives!  I want you in my life!    



               INT. JOHN'S TRUCK - DAY 

                                   JOHN
                         I'm not in control of that! I'm not
                         the one who makes the schedule,
                         Jen!   



               INT. JOHN'S TRUCK - DAY 

                                   JENNY
                         You're gone eighty percent of the
                         time and when you are home your so
                         worn out that you sleep ... 



               INT. JOHN'S TRUCK - DAY 

                                   JOHN 
                         What?  Wait, I can't ... 

               He pulls the phone away from his ear and sees that there are
               no bars on the phone.  

                                   JOHN (CONT'D)
                         ... I'm driving through the
                         mountains ... Jen? Jen! Ah, man I
                         lost the signal.   



               INT. JOHN AND JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY 

                                   JENNY
                         John? ... John? Are you there?  

               She throws the phone on the couch.  

                                   JENNY (CONT'D)
                         Forget it.  

               Cicilia stares at the phone then watches her mom walk away.  



               INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - DAY 

               John slams the door of an old, beat up diesel and walks into
               a truck stop restaurant. He sits on a stool at the counter. 
               KATHY (27), the waitress, hands him a menu.   

                                   KATHY 
                         Hi.  

                                   JOHN  
                         Hey. 

                                   KATHY
                         You want something to drink? 

                                   JOHN
                         Yeah, gimme a cola.  

               MARK (38), comes up and sits in the stool next to John.  

                                   MARK
                         Hey man ... 

                                   JOHN
                         Hey.  

               John leans forward on the counter and puts his head in his
               hands.  Mark watches him. 

                                   MARK
                         You look exhausted.  How long have
                         you been on the road? 

               John wearily shakes his head.  

                                   JOHN
                         I don't know.  I've lost track.  

               Kathy sets an icy glass of coke in front of John.  Mark looks
               out to John's truck and gestures with his head to John's rig.    

                                   MARK
                         That company your working for is
                         combustible, man, they burn
                         everybody out! I worked for 'em for
                         while. They just ... incinerate
                         people! They've got no respect for
                         their drivers!    

               John pulls up and opens his hands.  

                                   JOHN 
                         Well, this is what I do, man.  It
                         puts food on the table. It's just
                         ... it's what I do.   

                                   MARK
                         You have other choices.  

                                   JOHN
                         I'm a truck driver! I'm not a
                         lawyer or doctor or dentist.  What
                         choices do I have?   

                                   MARK
                         Nah, I drive truck. I love my job!  

               John looks out the window at Mark's truck.  



               EXT. THE LOGO ON MARK'S TRUCK - DAY 

               The sun hits the Basin Western logo on the side of Mark's

               John motions to Mark's truck.  

                                   JOHN
                         Is that yours?  Basin Western?   

                                   MARK
                         Yeah, they're great. They work
                         really hard to keep their drivers
                         happy, and they have really nice
                         equipment. Come on, man, I'll show
                         you the rig.   



               INT. MARK'S TRUCK - DAY 

               John and Mark step up and look inside the truck. It's filled
               with modern equipment and technology.   

                                   JOHN 
                         Nice!  

                                   MARK
                         So they operate out of Eastern Utah
                         and they only deliver to the
                         Western states.  Most deliveries
                         are regional.
                         You don't have to take long hauls
                         all the way across the country.
                         Which means ... 

               John nods understandingly.  

                                   JOHN
                         ... more home time. 

                                   MARK
                         Yeah.  My wife loves it.  And when
                         the wife ain't happy ain't nobody
                         happy!  Know what I mean?  

               John rolls his eyes.  

                                   JOHN
                         Yeah.  Ten four, good buddy.  So,
                         what do they pay? 

                                   MARK
                         I make decent money. They're
                         totally competitive.   

                                   JOHN
                         Are they looking for drivers?   

                                   MARK
                         Everybody's looking for drivers,
                         man. You shouldn't have to pick
